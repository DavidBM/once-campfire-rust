# Campfire in Rust

A Rust implementation of [ONCE Campfire](https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire). It uses the
existing SQLite database, storage layout and signed/encrypted cookies, so existing installs can
upgrade without migrating data or signing everyone out.

One `campfire` executable replaces Ruby, Puma, Redis, Resque and Thruster, with libvips and ffmpeg
for media. The Rails frontend ships with a few [port-owned overrides](crates/assets/OVERRIDES.md).
The app includes TLS, HTTP/2, Web Push, bot webhooks, search and Action Cable-compatible WebSockets.

## Running it

With [ONCE](https://github.com/basecamp/once), on a server with Docker:

```sh
once deploy ghcr.io/basecamp/once-campfire-rust --host chat.example.com
```

ONCE manages secrets, TLS, backups and upgrades. Or run Docker directly:

```sh
docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 443:443 \
  -e SECRET_KEY_BASE=... -e VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY=... -e VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY=... \
  -e TLS_DOMAIN=chat.example.com \
  -v campfire:/rails/storage \
  ghcr.io/basecamp/once-campfire-rust
```

- `TLS_DOMAIN` enables automatic Let's Encrypt certificates; `DISABLE_SSL` enables plain HTTP.
- `/rails/storage` holds the database, uploads, backups and certificates. Existing installs must
  keep their storage and secrets.
- Web Push needs a valid P-256 VAPID key pair in URL-safe Base64. `VAPID_SUBJECT` sets the contact
  URL; its default is `https://` plus the first `TLS_DOMAIN`, or the project's URL.
- The app listener on `TARGET_PORT` (3000) binds loopback. `TARGET_BIND` overrides this; that listener
  trusts `X-Forwarded-*` from whoever reaches it. Other settings are in
  [`config.rs`](crates/campfire/src/config.rs).
- Images support amd64 and arm64. `:latest` and version tags track
  [releases](https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire-rust/releases); `:main` tracks the main branch.

## Performance

Production images, identical seed data and four pinned hardware threads per app on an AMD Ryzen
AI MAX+ 395. These are medians of three interleaved runs on October 1, 2026, using Rust at
[`1ea6d6f`](https://github.com/basecamp/once-campfire-rust/commit/1ea6d6f6b24fd21e7d01e69b7c92df5c380bcbde).
The [full report](bench/results/emoon-pr43-production-20261001/report.md) records settings and ranges.

### HTTP throughput (16 concurrent clients)

| Route | Rails | Rust | Rust advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Room page | 217 req/s | 36,120 req/s | **166×** |
| Messages page | 403 req/s | 41,352 req/s | **103×** |
| Sidebar | 524 req/s | 34,339 req/s | **65×** |
| Search | 376 req/s | 33,510 req/s | **89×** |
| Post a message | 269 req/s | 6,817 req/s | **25×** |
| `/up` | 4,068 req/s | 233,085 req/s | **57×** |

### Latency and real time

| Measurement | Rails | Rust | Rust advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Room page p99, 64 clients | 463 ms | 3.1 ms | **151×** |
| Post a message p99, 64 clients | 381 ms | 13.9 ms | **27×** |
| Upload a 505 KB JPEG until its thumbnail is served | 107 ms | 27.6 ms | **3.9×** |
| Deliveries per second, 10,000 clients in one room | 9,167 | 671,674 | **73×** |
| Post to all 10,000 clients received, p50 | 1,823 ms | 39.6 ms | **46×** |
| Post to all 10,000 clients received, p99 | 2,644 ms | 61.1 ms | **43×** |
| Connect and subscribe 10,000 clients | 29.5 s | 1.4 s | **21×** |

Every client subscribed and received every broadcast. Rails' 10,000-client p50 delivery latency
ranged from 1.4 to 3.1 seconds between runs; Rust's ranged from 38.8 to 41.0 ms.

### Startup, memory and image size

| Measurement | Rails | Rust | Rust advantage |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cold start until `/up` answers | 2,731 ms | 157 ms | **17×** |
| Idle memory (container, including page cache) | 393 MB | 20 MB | **20×** |
| App memory, 10,000 idle clients (Pss) | 1,485 MB | 250 MB | **5.9×** |
| App memory, 10,000 clients under load (Pss) | 2,096 MB | 248 MB | **8.5×** |
| Whole container, 10,000 clients under load (Pss) | 3,182 MB | 248 MB | **13×** |
| Image size, unpacked | 933 MB | 168 MB | **5.5×** |
| Image size, compressed download | 359 MB | 67 MB | **5.3×** |

Idle container memory varies with page cache (Rust: 15–31 MB). Rails' container includes Redis
and Thruster; Rust runs one process. Image sizes are recorded in
[`sizes.json`](bench/results/emoon-pr43-production-20261001/sizes.json).

## Development

Check out the `reference/` submodule before building. Rust 1.98.1 is available through mise;
native media dependencies are specified in the [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile).

```sh
git submodule update --init
parity/bin/reference build
parity/bin/seed build
CAMPFIRE_REQUIRE_SEED=1 cargo test --workspace --exclude html5ever
cargo clippy --workspace --exclude html5ever --all-targets
parity/bin/candidate build
parity/bin/candidate compare
bench/run
```

Seed generation and parity checks need Docker. Tests without the seed skip app integration tests.
For local development, run `cargo run -p campfire -- server` with `SECRET_KEY_BASE` set
(or `SECRET_KEY_BASE_DUMMY=1`). Build an image with `docker build -t campfire-rust .`.

The parity harness compares HTML, DOM, accessibility trees, assets, Cable frames and screenshots
against Rails. See [`parity/SCREENS.md`](parity/SCREENS.md) for coverage and masks,
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for repository layout and working rules,
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for contributions, and [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md) for security reports.

## Known differences

The app keeps the Rails database, storage and current cookie formats compatible. Deliberate
behavior changes and compatibility limits are listed below.

<details>
<summary>Differences from Rails</summary>

- **WebSockets:** `permessage-deflate` without context takeover compresses each broadcast once
  for all subscribers. Decoded messages remain identical.
- **CSRF:** `Sec-Fetch-Site` replaces tokens. Writes accept `same-origin` and `same-site`, reject
  `cross-site` and missing headers over HTTPS with 422, and retain the `Origin` check. Plain HTTP
  accepts missing headers with `SameSite=Lax` cookies. Pages omit CSRF tags and fields; old tabs
  still work, but HTTPS forms require a browser that sends the header (Safari 16.4 or newer).
- **Jobs:** Redis and Resque are replaced by in-process queues with `JOB_CONCURRENCY` workers per
  job kind. Queued pushes and webhooks are lost on a crash; slow webhooks don't block pushes.
- **Push:** invalid VAPID keys disable push at boot. Subscriptions survive TLS/configuration
  failures and are deleted only on 404/410 or an invalid subscription P-256 key. Notification
  bodies are truncated with an ellipsis at 3 KB and titles at 256 bytes. `VAPID_SUBJECT` is configurable.
  Delivery timeouts are 10 seconds per connect/read and 30 seconds overall.
- **Cookies:** sessions are written only on change and deleted when empty; `last_room` only on
  change. `session_token` is re-signed on the hourly activity refresh, retaining its rolling
  20-year expiry. Other authenticated reads avoid the database writer.
- **Caching:** room, messages and search ETags hash cached page parts rather than the body.
  Copy-link buttons cache paths and resolve them against the page URL; bot JSON is cached per
  base URL, preventing a request's Host from changing other users' links.
- **SQLite:** boot adds `index_messages_on_room_id_and_created_at` if missing. It remains compatible
  with Rails. Memory mapping is disabled; reads use SQLite's page cache.
- **Media formats:** libvips 8.16.1 and ffmpeg 7.1.5 use the Rails image's Debian sources, with
  byte-identical thumbnails, posters and metadata for supported formats. libvips omits loaders
  Rails already blocks. ffmpeg omits external-library-only formats: tracker modules, game-console
  music, JPEG XL/SVG frames, codec2, teletext and DASH/IMF. Tracker/game-console uploads lack
  duration and bit rate. Unused encoders, muxers, hardware and network support are omitted.
- **Media processing:** message uploads are copied and checksummed before saving their rows, then
  deleted if saving fails. The redundant MD5 reread is skipped; analysis, variants, posters and
  client direct-upload checksums still validate files. At most four media jobs run off the database
  writer. Variants/posters are saved already analyzed; concurrent transforms keep the first saved
  result and delete duplicates. ffmpeg posters time out at 60 seconds, ffprobe at 30.
- **Request limits:** non-file-upload bodies and direct uploads are capped at 16 MiB (413).
  Nonnumeric direct-upload sizes and oversized QR codes return 422. Page numbers cap at a billion.
- **Cable limits:** 64 subscriptions per connection, 4 KiB identifiers and 1 MiB messages.
  Clients that don't read for 30 seconds disconnect. Banning/deactivating a user closes their
  connections after commit.
- **Unfurling:** 10 seconds overall, 5 per connect/read, at most 16 concurrent unfurls, and only
  the first 256 attributes of a `meta` tag are read. Timed-out pages unfurl nothing.
- **Webhooks:** 60 seconds overall, 7 per connect/read. Replies over 100 MB after decompression
  fail delivery without posting a response.
- **Front server:** `TARGET_PORT` binds loopback and enforces front-server timeouts and
  `MAX_REQUEST_BODY`. Cache keys count toward `CACHE_SIZE`, preserve raw paths/queries, skip URIs
  over 2 KB and forward range requests. Idle HTTP/1 connections close at the shorter of
  `HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT` and `HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT` until request headers arrive (30 seconds with defaults,
  60 with image settings); HTTP/2 uses the idle timeout. Response header lines containing DEL are omitted.
- **Passwords:** bcrypt runs outside database connections/transactions. Unknown emails still
  perform one bcrypt check.
- **JSON:** floats use the shortest equivalent digits. The web app manifest properly JSON-escapes
  account names and URLs.
- **Search:** words are literal full-text terms, including `NOT`, `AND`, `OR` and `NEAR`.
- **Routes and UI:** `/rooms/directs/:id` redirects to the room; infinite `Accept` q-values sort
  first or last by sign; EdgeHTML install instructions include the missing image; the new-ping
  picker requests JSON so suggestions appear.
- **Rich text attributes:** autolinking escapes `<`/`>` in attributes to prevent stored XSS.
  Sanitization drops `name` attributes to prevent DOM clobbering. Styles retain only `color` and
  `background-color` with plain keyword/hex/RGB/HSL values or CSS variables in bot/webhook HTML;
  message pages drop styles.
- **Rich text attachments:** content attachments nest at most eight levels; deeper content is
  empty. Deleted-user mentions render ☒ and are omitted in the editor. Active Storage attachments
  embedded in message bodies, which the composer can't create, render ☒.
- **Malformed rich text:** plain-text extraction failures are logged and use empty text or an
  attachment filename; messages are still indexed, pushed, broadcast and sent to bots. Bodies
  beyond 400 nesting levels or 400 attributes per element are stored unchanged with empty plain
  text. These messages render as unrenderable.
- **Not ported:** Active Storage streaming's duplicate `session_token` cookie or legacy AES-CBC
  cookies; Campfire uses AES-GCM.

HTTP-01 ACME validation is only unit-tested; TLS-ALPN-01 is tested end to end against a local ACME
server. Rich text is checked against Rails on 658 cases, including 400 fuzzed cases.
